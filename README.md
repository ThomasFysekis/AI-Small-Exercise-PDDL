# AI-Small-Exercise-PDDL

PDDL is an attempt to standardize Artificial Intelligence planning languages.I created a small domain with hero - rooms - monsters - pits - treasures - weapons.The goal is from the original position of the hero to take all the treasures and go back alive. <br />  <br /> 
There are 2 problems (Monster1,Monster2) for our hero.  <br /> 
Here is the image of the first :  <br />  ![df](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72731525/118113544-1cff9680-b3ef-11eb-8817-dedce265c201.png)

Here is the image of the second : <br /> ![mon2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72731525/118113690-45879080-b3ef-11eb-9dac-1e3ba7ea2799.png) <br /> <br /> 

More obvious details: Hero needs to take a weapon so he can pass the monster cave - same goes for the cave with the pit.To pass the pit he needs the flying shoes.He can only use the weapons one time,if he wants to pass the monster cave (again or for the first time) he needs to take a weapon from any close cave. <br />
There are 3 PDDL files , the domain and the 2 problem.
